# Files and directories

To create a file we use: `touch <name>` and a directory with `mkdir <name>`, with `mkdir` we can use `-p` to create multiple directories within other directories, to see the structure we use `tree .`.

With the command `mv` we can move and rename files, example: `mv info.txt userinfo.txt`

To copy we use `cp` example: `cp storage/readme.txt storage/documents/readme.txt`

`rm` to remove/delete files/directories,

## Editing

Using `nano <route to the file>` we can edit the file. With `ctrl + o` we save the file and with `ctrl + x` we exit and can see the changes with `cat <route to the file>`.
