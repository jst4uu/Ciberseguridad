# My first machine to solve

First they ask me to connect to a target with the credentials they give me.

I tried and i failed my first try

I try searching the hostname, i try again

I solve the first question

After a lot of tries, I finally connected to the target

THEY ASKS ME FOR THE MAIL?????

Well, I just completed my first HTB machine, it take me TWO hours

now I know i have to test ALL the commands i have, even if they don't seem usable.
